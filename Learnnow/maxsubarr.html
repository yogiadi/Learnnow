      <h1>Maximum subarray</h1>
      <p>Given an array containing both negative and positive values we need to find the contiguous array which has the maximum sum. This can be done by divide and conquer method. In this method we will assume that this array crosses the midpoint. It may or may not actually has the maximum but having this assumption will help in using divide and conquer method.</p>
      <p>Divide the array into two parts from the middle. <br>
      From middle to the left calculate the sum of all the elements and store the index of the element having largest sum.<br>
      Again from middle to the right store the index of the element having largest sum. <br>
      The array crossing the mid value and spanning from left to thr right will be the array having the maximum sum. <br></p>
      <b>Base step</b>
      <ol>Find middle element.</ol>
      <ol>From middle element calculate sum till the left most element and find the left element.</ol>
      <ol>From middle element calculate sum till the right most element and find the right element.</ol>
      <b>Iterative step</b>
      <ol>Find maximum subarray crossing mid point of the array.</ol>
      <ol>Find maximum subarray of the left part of the array</ol>
      <ol>Find maximum subarray of the right part of the array.</ol>
      <ol>The maximum subarray will be the largest of the three that is crossing the mid point , left and right array.</ol>


      <b>Problem</b>
      <p>The glaring problem of above code is that it only caters for the element passing the middle position. In this case we will divide our array into much smaller parts rather recursively to make sure that almost all the elements are treated as middle element at some point. </p>

      <b>Solution</b>
      <p>Create a recursive function which will call itself by breaking the original array it was provided into two parts. This function will again be called for the left and right array. If there are 8 elements in the original array it will break the array into two having 4 elements each. Again for the left array it will break into two parts containing 2 elements and finally having one element each. </p>
      <p>The innermost array will return the value and subsequently return the maximum subrray of the larger array. </p>
      <p>After finding the maximum sum subarray in left and right , we will get the maximum sub array crossing the midpoint. Till now we have exluded the midpoint. The elements having greatest sum of all the left , right and crossing the midpoint will be returned.</p> 
      Implementation of maximum subarray in python is below
