      <h1>Merge Sort</h1>
      <p>In merge sort , one large array is divided into several parts until only one element is left. Then all the sorted arrays are merged.Since arrays are broken into half hence they are broken into logn level.<br>
      <b>Base step</b>
      <ol>Elements of sorted arrays are compared and merged.</ol>
      <b>Iterative steps</b>
      <ol>Extract mid point of array .</ol>
      <ol>Call merge sort on left half and right half of the array.</ol>
          <br>
          For example consider below array 
          <br>
          7 2 9 10 34 27 5 4
          <br>
          This array will be divided into half the size of their parent array.
          <br>
          7 2 9 10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;34 27 5 4
          <br>
          7 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9 10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;34 27 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 4
          <br>
          7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 27 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4
          <br>
          Once arrays are divided into smaller parts , then we can merge the arrays as per the sorted.
          <br>
          7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 27 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4
          <br>
          2 7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9 10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;27 34 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4 5
          <br>
          2 7 9 10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4 5 27 34
          <br>
          2 4 5 7 9 10 27 34
          <br>
          Time complexity analysis<br>
          No of levels for an array of size N= logn<br>
          No of comparisons at each level=n <br>
          Time complexity of merge sort is O(nlogn).<br>
          Implementation of merge sort in python is below
