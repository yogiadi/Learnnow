      <h1>Insertion Sort</h1>
      <p>Insertion sort is a sorting method where an array is divided into two parts , one which is already sorted and other which needs to be sorted and the elements are added in such a way that the resultant array is sorted. <br>

      <b>Base Step</b>

        <ol>Store element in a variable.</ol>
        <ol>Compare with elements in sorted array. </ol>
        <ol>Shift element if given element is less than elements.</ol>

      <b>Iterative step</b>
      <ol>Iterate over all the elements starting from second position.</ol>
          For example consider below array 
          <br>
          7 2 9 10 34 27 5 4
          <br>
          Lets divide the array into two parts one which is sorted and other as not sorted.
          <br>
          
          7 - Sorted
          <br>
          
          2 9 10 34 27 5 4 - Unsorted
          
          <br>
          Now insert 2 in the sorted array such that the first part remains sorted.
          
          <br>
          
          2 7 - Sorted
          <br>
          9 10 34 27 5 4 - Unsorted
          <br>
          
          Similarly inserting other elements will result in 
          <br>
          2 7 9 - Sorted
          <br>
          10 34 27 5 4 - Unsorted
          <br>
          2 7 9 10- Sorted
          <br>
          34 27 5 4 - Unsorted
          <br>
          2 7 9 10 34 - Sorted
          <br>
          27 5 4 - Unsorted
          <br>
          2 7 9 10 27 34- Sorted
          <br>
          5 4 - Unsorted
          
          <br>
          2 5 7 9 10 27 34- Sorted
          <br>
          4 - Unsorted
          <br>
          2 4 5 7 9 10 27 34- Sorted
          
          Lets build pseudo code for insertion sort considering an array A with length as n :-
          <br>
          Step1. Divide array into two parts sorted and unsorted. We will divide the array into a sorted array of first element and the rest of the elements as unsorted array.So iteration will start from second element to the last element.
          <br>
          for i=2 to n
          <br>
          Step2. Comparison will start from i-1 position , so we can assign a variable called j.
          <br>
          j=i-1
          <br>
          Step3. Store the value of A[i] in a temporary variable temp.<br>
          temp=A[i]<br>
          Step4. A[i] element will keep moving to left until j =0 or A[i] is greater than A[j]
          <br>
          while A[j]>key and j > 0<br>
          Step5. To keep moving the elements shift jth element to j+1 element.<br>
          A[j+1]=A[j]<br>
          Step6. jth pointer needs to move to left after each comparison<br>
          j=j-1<br>
          Step7.After loop and comparison key should be established at (j+1)th element.<br>
          A[j+1]=key<br>
          
          Hence pseudo code for insertion sort is<br>
          for i=2 to n<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;j=i-1<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;temp=A[i]<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while A[j]>key and j > 0<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A[j+1]=A[j]<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;j=j-1<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A[j+1]=key<br>
          </p>
        <p>Below is the implementation of insertion sort in Python.</p>
        <pre><code>
            def insertionsort(A):
	           n=len(A)
	           print("Length of " , A , " is " , n)
	           for i in range(1,n):
		          print("i is ",i)
		          j=i-1
		          print("j is ",j)
		          temp=A[i]
		          print("temp is ",temp)
		          while (A[j]>temp and j>=0):
			         print("jth element is ",A[j]," greater than temp is ",temp)
			         print("A[j+1] ",A[j+1]," will be assigned with A[i] ",A[j])
			         A[j+1]=A[j]
			         print("j ",j," will be j-1 ",j-1)
			         j=j-1
		             print("A[j+1] ",A[j+1]," will be assigned with temp ",temp)
		          A[j+1]=temp
